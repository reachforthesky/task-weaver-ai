Well folks it finally happened. I failed my goal I set yesterday. Other priorities got in the way, and when I finally went to make a feeble attempt at researching what I needed to know, I just couldn't focus enough to learn it. After banging my head against a wall for a bit I finally called it quits and started making dinner.

In the past when I broke a win-streak like this, I immediately threw in the towel. It felt like my progress was a bubble that finally popped. I didn't want to think about how long it would take to get back to where I was. I was so obsessed with perfection I refused to appreciate what I had actually accomplished.

This failure could be a good excersize in learning how to get back up on the horse. Instead of wallowing, I'll just take a moment to ponder what led to my failure. I think what really killed me was a lack of preparation and concrete goal. I had a vague idea of what I wanted to do but I really didn't nail it down well enough that I had a clear path forward. Plus, assuming you'll successfully "learn on the fly" is a perilous decision that can bite you in ways you don't expect.

I'm going back to the drawing board. I'll watch a few videos on Express and Node and see if I can attack this goal with a clearer head tomorrow.
