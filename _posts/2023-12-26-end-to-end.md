I'm finally back home after a week of travel. After nearly four days of spinning my wheels I finally made some concrete progress. Here's how I've been spending my time.

<b>1. I played with the idea of using a React framework, before ultimately deciding not to.</b>
I'm not very good at explaining what a "framework" is so I'll let ChatGPT take this one:

>Imagine you want to build a house. Instead of starting from scratch, digging the foundations, and shaping each brick yourself, what if you had a toolkit with pre-made foundations, bricks, windows, and a set of guidelines on how to put them together efficiently? That's essentially what a programming framework is in the world of software development.

React itself is just a library, more like a small toolbox that helps you build houses. After dipping my toes in a few popular frameworks I decided it would be best if I familiarized myself with vanilla React for this project.

<b>2. I decided to use Bootstrap and created a Navigation Header.</b>
Bootstrap is just a library that make creating UI components easier. It's a step up from your basic HTML UI elements, so there's no need to re-invent the wheel here. Look at the pretty navbar.

<b>3. I can now send requests to my API from my React front end</b>
This was the greatest undertaking of my life to date. I spent hours figuring out Routing, JSX, hooks, and a handful of random libraries just to be able to display a couple of rows from my database in my React UI. Feast your eyes;

It's embarassing how long it took me to make this thing work. I will likely need a few days to recuperate. I set no goal for myself until the year 2024 arrives.
