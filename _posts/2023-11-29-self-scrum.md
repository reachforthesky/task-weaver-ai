I've been making a lot of sweeping statements about agile lately, so I think now is as good a time as any to point out that agile doesn't refer to one method of software development, but rather a set of principles that various methods adhere to. Some of these methods were established and used for years, actually predating the term "agile" that would become their umbrella term. In 2001, the originators of these methods got together, compiled some ideas they all had in common, and summarized them in ["the Agile Manifesto."](https://agilemanifesto.org/)

One such method is called Scrum. Now to be clear, every software team that uses Scrum does it a little different, but there are a few artifacts that are fairly universal. Yesterday I described the concept of sprints, user stories, and a product backlog, but today I will be talking about the most maligned of them all, the daily scrum.

At the start of each day, the scrum team has a quick "stand-up" meeting, so called because everybody is supposed to stand up for the duration, in order to encourage brevity. During the meeting everyone describes what they accomplished the previous day, what they plan to do that day, and mention anything that may be hindering their work. The intended purpose is to enable the team leadership to understand their teams progress and handle any obstacles impeding their developers.

My first software job was with a military contractor, and we had these meetings each morning. The other, more experienced devs hated them because they felt they were a huge waste of time. I hated them because I didn't know how to do my job and never had any progress to report. The leadership hated them because every meeting seemed to point to more delays. For a long time I felt like the whole process was useless at best and detrimental to progress at worst.

That was years ago, and it's time to set my differences with Scrum aside and find out how these practices can make me a more effective developer. Obviously I'm not going to arrange a "meeting" with myself, but I will be setting aside a bit of time each day to review and plan my work. At the end of each work session I'll make a list of what I accomplished and what slowed me down or blocked me. At the beginning I'll take some time to strategize and research how to mitigate the obstacles from the day before and plan what I want to accomplish that day, based on my sprint plan, current progress and what's going on in my real life.

Tomorrow I'm going to work a bit on the backlog, maybe create an epic and break it down into stories.
