Want to give a heads up to anyone who already has some development experience, this series is going to start very slow. We're starting with the bare basics, I wouldn't blame anyone for skipping quite a few of these early entries.

I'm off to a bad start. My manager generously let me leave work two hours early and even got home ten minutes faster than usual due to the lack of rush hour traffic. The perfect opportunity to get a huge leg up on this new project. Instead as soon as I got home I scarfed down a bunch of junk food and napped. Where did all that motivation from last night go? Why does my brain only ever want to start doing anthing useful starting at 11pm? Truly I am my own worst enemy.

Now the exciting part is over, and the work begins. First of all, I've already gotten ahead of myself. The whole point of this blog/project (Blogject? Much to think about) was to show my work for those wishing to follow in my clumsy footsteps. And here I am, day 2 and I'm already slouching on the documentation. Let's back up.

Yesterday I had an idea. I was playing with ChatGPT (literally) and as so often happens during our chats I was repeatedly struck dumb by the potential it was demonstrating. I started getting those all-too-familiar sparks of inspiration as the possibilities, followed by the predictable voices of doubt. Lately, anytime I get excited about a project, I am bombarded with negative thoughts, usually they're singing the same tune every time.

"You're going to hit a million speed bumps before you start seeing the light at the end of the tunnel."

"There's no way your the first person to think of this, what's even the point? Nobody will care."

"You know you aren't going to finish anyway. Might as well spare yourself the stress and quit now."

Most of these thoughts I can shrug off but that last one is usually enough to rock me to sleep. Mostly because there's a mountain of evidence to confirm it. But this time I start to wonder, is it possible ChatGPT can do enough of the heavy-lifting to carry me over the finish line, like a weird robot Samwise to my Frodo? Might as well give it a shot. I come up with a plan to kill three birds with one stone.

1. Create a proof-of-concept development strategy demonstrating how ChatGPT can be leveraged to take a product from inception to release
2. Create a tool that *I personally* can use to make all subsequent projects I work on easier for me.
3. Document everything in a blog to set an example for all who struggle as I do.

Now I know I go a bit hard on the "self-deprication" angle but I can say with confidence that I at least know enough to get started. Even so, I'm going to try to include Chats explaining everything I'm doing...as soon as I learn how to embed them. First things first, we're going to need a repo, and the obvious choice for me is Github. I log in to my account and [create a new repo](https://chat.openai.com/share/23c74c65-4fb1-4a73-b7b3-24216b55d027). I had ChatGPT [generate a bunch of potential names](https://chat.openai.com/share/1876b21c-373a-40d2-926c-5a050ab06d0f) and picked one that didn't completely suck, "TaskWeaverAI". I routinely get paralyzed by completely inconsequential decisions like this so having a tool that can cut through my mental red-tape is a godsend. I clone my repo using Github's newish desktop app, type up my first blog post in a markup file using Visual Studio Code and push the change. I turn on Github pages and poof, my first blog post is published.

Today I...wrote this blog post, basically. I really hoped I would be more productive today but at the very least I want to write a bit about the issues I've faced historically and how I plan on addressing them with this project.

    1. Motivation: I often start off these projects with plenty of energy, then once I get bogged down in the work I start to lose interest. I have a few countermeasures I want to try employing this time. The first is breaking down the project into digestible tasks that I know I can accomplish even when I'm not feeling 100%. The second is this blog, which I believe will give me a reason to chip away at the project at least a little bit each day. Every post will end with a goal for the enxt day that I should be able to complete even if I go full sloth-mode.
   
    2. Planning: I am terrible about this. I feel like trying to plan out an entire project is just impossible if you aren't very confident in your abilities as a PM and an architect. I have a pretty good general idea of what I want to do, but I certainly don't think I'll have a good grasp of what the final product should look like without actually building it. So for this project I am going to commit to not writing a single line of code until I have a plan I can be proud of (with the exception of whatever I need to do to get this blog in an acceptable state).

    3. The Not-Coding: Organizing my project, creating design documents, commenting, testing; I am awful about this stuff. This time around I am going to try and dedicate a section of each blog entry to summarizing my maintenance efforts for the day, good or bad.

On top of my already mentioned counter-measures, I will be regularly consulting our AI overlords on how to tackle these issues as I'm working through them.
   
Let's make a habit of setting a goal for the next day at the end of these posts. Tomorrow I plan to, at minimum, create a page containing links to these posts.

In other news, Sam Altman is back at OpenAI. Looks like my gravy-train is still on the tracks.
