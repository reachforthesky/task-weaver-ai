Yesterday I came up with a single user story for TaskWeaver. Before I talk about it, I'll go over what a user story is. And by "go over" I mean "have ChatGPT [explain it for me.](https://reachforthesky.github.io/task-weaver-ai/assets/blog-content/11-28-2023/User-Stories-for-Beginners.html)"

>User Stories are like short requests for new features in software. They follow a simple format: "As a [user], I want to [do something], so that [I get some benefit]." For instance, "As a website visitor, I want to create an account so that I can access exclusive content." These stories help teams understand what users need and why, making it easier to plan and build software in a way that meets users' expectations.
