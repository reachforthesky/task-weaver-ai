Yesterday I came up with a single user story for TaskWeaver. Before I talk about it, I'll go over what a user story is. And by "I'll go over" I mean "I'll have ChatGPT [explain for me.](https://reachforthesky.github.io/task-weaver-ai/assets/blog-content/11-28-2023/User-Stories-for-Beginners.html)"

>User Stories are like short requests for new features in software. They follow a simple format: "As a [user], I want to [do something], so that [I get some benefit]." For instance, "As a website visitor, I want to create an account so that I can access exclusive content." These stories help teams understand what users need and why, making it easier to plan and build software in a way that meets users' expectations.

Who knew blogging was so easy?

User stories represent the goals of a project. A very ambitious story that can be broken down into smaller ones is sometimes called an "epic". Stories are typically broken down into "tasks" that can be completed in a short amount of time, and when all the tasks that make up a story is completed, the story is done. A running list of incomplete epics and stories that the customer wants included in the project are kept in what's called the "project backlog".

In Scrum (one of many agile methodologies), we also have a term called "sprints". A Sprint is a period of time in the development of a project, usually 1-4 weeks, where the team attempts to complete a specific set of work items. At the beginning of a sprint, the team looks at the current backlog and decides which user stories will be included in the sprint, divides those stories into tasks and assigns them to different team members. At the end of the sprint there's a retrospective, incomplete tasks and stories are punted into the next sprint, and the whole process starts over again until the client is happy (never).

Now, how is this relevant to what I'm trying to do? I don't have a customer or a team, so why would I need to structure my project using a method created to facillitate collaboration? In fact, why would a Lone Ranger like myself need to conform to any structure at all instead of just...working on it until it's done? There are many reasons, here are the three big ones.

1. I struggle to stay motivated when I'm chipping away at a large project. It's much easier for me to get started working on a small task that I know I can knock out in a short amount of time.
2. Setting attainable goals that I can safely commit to each week helps me keep my momentum.
3. Agile encourages good coding habits that I tend to slack on when nobody is looking over my shoulder.

I'm going to spend the next two days thinking, researching and writing about how I'm going to adapt agile principles to my solo-development, and how I might get ChatGPT involved.
