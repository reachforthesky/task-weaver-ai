No progress again. That one really stings. I'm trying to be patient with myself, but how patient is too patient? Today I was Redlining so much at work that i was completely vulnerable when I got home. I can't lie, I broke down a little. I cried to my parents, and then just opened up to wife. I kind of just gave myself permission to take a night off from blogging, so I'm having to time-travel a bit to fix that mistake.

It's really hard to just come up with a set of rules to follow, or an algorithm for life, that sets you up for "success," both according to our current reality, and our own goals. When we break our closely held beliefs, we betray ourselves. And we make all kinds of promises all the time. My personal favorite right now is "I'll do better next time". But what does that promise even mean, if you're just going to start from the same place you did before, with the same set of directions? Do you just wait around for a hero to come save you? Let Jesus take the wheel? Dip back into the same wells you've always gone to? Or will you dig deep, and find something that wasn't there before, something brand spanking new to add to the equation. When we have to step up like this and make a decision, it can be very scary. It can feel like sitting with all your tools, wondering if you need to put any of them away to make room for something more purpose-built.

Trying to change yourself takes time. It takes patience. It means carefully weighing what needs to go and what needs to stay. But nothing gone stays gone forever, for better works. The important thing is your priorities. If you're thinking about making a big change this year, take this opportunity to get real with yourself. Have you been good about following-up on your resolutions in the past? Or have you set your target too high too soon, and fallen short? Or maybe you just couldn't see a bright enough light at the end of the tunnel, and didn't feel like it was worth the hassel. If you're struggling with meeting new goals, consider taking this year to instead cling to everything you love, and see what you're left with when it's all over.

Tomorrow I'm just going to chill with my wife.
