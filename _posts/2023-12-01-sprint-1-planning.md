It's finally time to plan my first sprint. The first thing to do is decide what user stories will be included in the sprint. Now, I have a lot of foundation to lay and plenty going on in my life outside this project, so for this first week I'm going to aim low, and just try to crank out one, simple story.

>Story: "As a user, I would like to input a project's core purpose, and be prompted to input its subtasks, so that I can begin to create a task hierarchy for my project

Now this is not exactly going to blow anyone's socks off. It's basically describing a to-do list, which just about every cs grad and their dog has created at some point. But a critical aspect of agile is delivering *working* software quickly, then building upon it iteratively. The motivation behind this is simple; things change. If you're building software for a customer, or consumers, you can't expect them to know, right now, exactly what they will ultimately need from your application months or years down the line. 

Before agile was popularized, we had "waterfall development" where programmers meticulously planned, created, and tested software over a much longer cycle before delivering. Imagine working on something for months, and when you finally show it to your client, they tell you it looks nothing like what they wanted. What if you get halfway through, and the client tells you that there's a new innovation in their field and they need your product to work completely different than what was already promised. 

By delivering working software immediately, users can get their hands on it, tell you what they like and dislike, and work out any misunderstandings about the long-term goals of the project. They might even start using an early iteration, and through working with it dream up new features they might want added to the backlog.

Before I start breaking down our story into tasks, I need to decide on the tech stack I'll be using for this project. I'm referring to the set of tools and languages I'll be using to actually build the dang thing. Now I could go with what I use professionally (Angular, .Net and mssql) but I kind of want to learn something new so I'm going to go with the MERN stack, which I'll talk about later...mostly because right now I know nothing about it besides the fact that it's free and widespread. 

Wow, I've been going on and on and I haven't planned a single day of the sprint. I tried to [get help from my AI overlords.](https://reachforthesky.github.io/task-weaver-ai/assets/blog-content/12-01-2023/Sprint-Planning-for-Software.html) but I was pretty unimpressed with the results. I'm pretty tired so I'm just going to set a goal for each of the next seven days and break it down at the beginning of each work session. I'll try to fit the really big tasks in this weekend because I'll probably only have an hour a day during the work week to chip away at it.
