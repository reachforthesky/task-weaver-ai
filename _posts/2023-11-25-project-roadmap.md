Well this is embarassing. Five days of talking a big game about improved productivity and effectiveness and we haven't even started the project beyond setting up a Github repo. I won't stand for this waffling any longer, I vow to keep my eyes glued to my laptop until I at least have a plan of action. As a reminder, here's the "elevator pitch" of the project.

"A tool that will take as its input a core purpose, mission statement, or ultimate goal of a project and use generative AI to break it down into a navigable, interactive task hierarchy"

[I took a few cracks at having ChatGPT plan this project.](../../../assets/blog-content/11-25-2023/Project%20Steps%20Tool.html) Frankly I'm not really happy with the results. There are three major issues I have with its output:

1. The steps it provides are not really serialized well. By that I mean, they might get the job done, but they aren't really sorted in order of when they need to be completed. For example, Testing and Documentation are in there, but they are both tasks that need to be done *alongside* the actual development, parallel with coding.
2. It's including several steps that are completely irrelevant to my goals. 
3. The steps aren't really structured according to Agile principles, even after I include it in the prompt.

Now, these aren't really a problem for me as far as planning *this* project. I'm more than capable of making the necessary adjustments to the output to plot a course that works for me. If I was feeling really crazy I might even refer to one of the numerous books, articles, and videos that will tell you exactly how to plan a software project like this one. But it is a bit worrying considering my plans for using the output to automatically create task hierarchies. 

Let's make some changes to the prompt. First of all, we're going to establish that first and foremost what I want is a mapped out [project lifecycle.](https://www.wrike.com/project-management-guide/project-lifecycle/) I'm going to be more specific about what methodology I want used. Now that I've been very clear about how I want the output formatted, I'll add the core purpose of the project.

[Now *that*, I can work with.](../../../assets/blog-content/11-25-2023/Agile%Scrum%for%Software.html) It's definitely going to need some revision but this is much closer to something I can use. You may be thinking "This output doesn't reference your specific core purpose or breakdown your project into steps at all, how will this help you with planning more than any other free resource?" and to that I say...I'm tired, it's the weekend, *please* stop bothering me. I promised a plan of action and I technically have one. Tomorrow I'll elaborate on how we can get a bit more detailed with our plans.
