Happy Thanksgiving everyone! I spent a lovely day with my friends full of food, laughter, and gastric distress. Now that the festivities are over, let's see if we can't at least set up a page that contains links to all my blog posts.

I don't really know much about markdown, but ChatGPT lays it all out for me and gives me very nearly the exact file I need.

Hey look, I learned how to embed images too! I had a bit of trouble with the image path but ChatGPT set me straight And I suppose this is as good a time as any to figure out the best way to embed my Chats. Surprisingly, ChatGPT doesn't really know a simple way to do this, so for now I'll just include [links to the chats](https://chat.openai.com/share/9f9e5d3f-a76f-4e7b-9da0-00f654333f74) where it's relevant. Funnily enough, ChatGPT is apparently unaware that you can share links to chats because its knowledge cutoff is nearly two years ago, so it kind of biffs that one, but it still basically gives me the info I need. At some point in the future I'll need to revisit this issue because I would much prefer specific parts of these chats be embedded in these pages, and I would like to be able to delete the chats from my OpenAI account without them disapearing from my blog. But I feel like I've done enough for the day, it's a holiday after all.

Tomorrow I plan on tweaking the blog page so that it's automatically updated with links to new blog posts once they're added. No way I'm going to remember to manually update it every time.

Before I sign off, there's one more thing I need to include in today's post. All of this blogging and coding talk lately reminded me of a tech and gaming blogger that I used to follow quite religiously, Shamus Young. This morning I decided to check his blog and see what kind of content he was posting nowadays. I immediately noticed that the most recent posts all listed his children as authors, none of them were written by him. After a minute or so of digging through his blog, I found out why. [He passed away over a year ago, at the age of 50](https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=54513).

I was completely devastated. Throughout highschool I probably read every word and consumed every piece of content he published, either on his blog or the Escapist. His software blogs were my single biggest inspiration for wanting to be a programmer. I still haven't completely processed my emotions at the time of writing this, more than anything I'm incredulous I went so long without finding out. However, I do know for certain that I will now be dedicating this project to him. I absolutely would not be the same person I am today if he hadn't chosen to share his knowledge, experience, and wisdom with the world. [This post](https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?page_id=15033) contains links to his works which impacted me the most, namely his software and autobiographical series.

RIP Shamus, and thank you.
