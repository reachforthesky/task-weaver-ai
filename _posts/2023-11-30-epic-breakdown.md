We're getting close to the fun stuff. I promised myself I would lay a good foundation for this project before getting started and I think, so far, I've delivered. Tomorrow I'm going to plan my first sprint, so I think it would behoove me to get my backlog ready beforehand. Right now my backlog consists of a single user story I came up with a few days ago.

>"As a user, I would like to input a project's core purpose, and be prompted to input its subtasks, so that I can begin to create a task hierarchy for my project"

Pathetic. Where's the ambition? The vision? This isn't going to be your dad's to-do-list app, this is going to be a serious tool for seriously productive doers. Let's beef that sucker up into an *epic*.

>"As a user, I would like to input a project's core purpose, and generate a complete task hierarchy, with a predetermined format (Like an agile lifecycle or product backlog) that can be navigated and interacted with."

Now I just need to break this down into stories. We already have the first one, [here's how I would split up the whole thing](https://reachforthesky.github.io/task-weaver-ai/assets/blog-content/11-30-2023/TaskWeaver-AI-Backlog.md). Not too hard, and that about covers the bulk of the functionality I'm interested in right now. That being said, this is exactly the kind of thing I want my tool to be doing for me, so as a little expirement let's feed ChatGPT a description of my epic and [look at its output.](https://reachforthesky.github.io/task-weaver-ai/assets/blog-content/11-30-2023/Task-Hierarchy-Generator.html)

Wow, that's...pretty much exactly what I'd hoped for. The stories probably need a little tweaking and re-prioritizing, and that optional "user authentication" task could probably be its own epic, but I could absolutely work with this if I wanted to. I'm actually quite tempted to use it for this project but I feel compelled to at least try to do things manually one time before I hoist my entire workload onto my little AI intern.

Tomorrow is sprint planning, then the real fun begins.
