Ok maybe I was being a bit dramatic yesterday, I don't actually *want* to waste the next four or five days laying about. I would however like to take a bit of the pressure off myself to write an entire soliloquy every day I so much as pick my nose in front of my computer screen, so I'm going to start packing in a few days worth of work into each of these blog posts when I don't have enough to write about after just one night of effort.

Additionally, from now one I'm going to be introducing a little structure into my updates. From now on I'm going to inject a handful of these mini-dev-diaries into my posts:

Goal: Refactor front end and change top-level-tasks into buttons
Completed before EOD: Complete
Entry: I have once again decided to completely re-arrange the structure of my front end. This took quite a bit of doing, creating and renaming files and folders, fixing import statements, moving entire code blocks from one file to another and learning all about React "Props", which I might consider explaining in one of these posts as soon as I understand them myself. 

I'm also going to back out of setting up sprints for myself at least until I have my MVP. It's kind of ridiculous to expect myself to be able to meet an agressive timeline when I don't even know how to use my tech stack yet. So for now I'm going to adhere to more of a "slog" schedule, wherein I just knock down tasks as quickly as I can manage until I'm happy with what I'm looking at.
