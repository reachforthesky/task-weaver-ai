Well now there's a whopping 11-day gap between my project entries. I just got out of the hospital so I'm going to keep this one short and sweet. Sometimes your best laid plans just get laid to waste by the real world knocking on your door. In this case however, I wouldn't really consider my plans to have been laid as well as I would like. I'm going to "restart" my first sprint from where I'm at currently, with a mongoDB database set up and a goal of getting a node.js backend up and running by Sunday night. Now, that's still pretty vague so I'm going to give this task a "DoD" or "Definition of Done".

I'll consider my backend off to a good start when I have a single API call that can add a new task to the database. In REST terms this would be a POST request, adding a new resource to a collection. That is almost criminally minimalistic, but I have a lot going on right now and can't put as much time into this project as I would like. If I can get this done by tomorrow I'll consider adding more REST methods.
