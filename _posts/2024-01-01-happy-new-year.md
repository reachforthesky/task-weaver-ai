I hope everyone had a wonderful New Years Eve celebration. Personally, I celebrated by rewarding myself with a good night's sleep so that I could wake up bright and early and get started playing [Shipbreaker.](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1161580/Hardspace_Shipbreaker/) I can not stress enough how much I would rather be playing it right now instead of working on my side project, but I can't start the new year with such an unproductive mindset. Let's see, what does taskweaver even look like right now?

Oh right. New Computer. Database gone.

Time to reinstall MongoDB. And create some sample data. Which means reinstalling the desktop Postman agent. And fixing my project files so my back end runs properly.

We're off to a great start.

After the herculean task of getting back to where I was a few days ago I find myself stuck in a real rut, so I decided to just let ChatGPT 4 take the reins for my next task; displaying a clicked task in my TaskDetails component (the white space next to my green TaskExplorer component).

[It does a phenomenal job](https://reachforthesky.github.io/task-weaver-ai/assets/blog-content/01-01-2024/Update-TaskView-for-Clicked-Task.html), as I've come to expect. Here's how we're lookin now.

I promise once I have my MVP I'll double-back and drill down into some of these code "suggestions". I'm kind of attacking this project from two directions, educating myself about the basics of React until I get to the content needed to understand my code thus far. Let's just take a moment and marvel at how useful ChatGPT is for writing code, provided you know what you're asking for. By next post I should be able to display the selected task description and its subtasks.
