![My reddit habit.](https://reachforthesky.github.io/task-weaver-ai/assets/blog-content/11-29-2023/DrilReddit.png)

Today I had the most productive day at my day job in weeks, and took a big chunk out my current backlog of tasks that has barely budged for the past month. The main driver of my newfound effectiveness is undoubtably my decision to uninstall the reddit app from my phone. 

It all started the other day when I read the [last "personal" post Shamus Young punblished](https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=54261) on his blog before his passing. Reading it was very difficult for me, both because of the emotions I was feeling about his death and how painfully relatable the subject is. In it he describes being stuck in a mental rut, or "Zombie Mode" as he calls it, wasting a significant amount of time on increasingly meaningless pursuits, and he mentions scrolling reddit specifically. 

That post really gave me the kick I needed to just cut myself off. I don't think the DSM considers social media an addiction, but I can't think of any term that describes my habit better. Before I was spending several hours a day on the app. It was how I consumed all my news and discovered new content. Every moment there was a lull at work I had my phone out. I would tell myself I was just "filling time gaps" but those gaps would mysteriously stretch to 20-30 minutes before I would be snapped back into reality. I would feel the urge to open the app whenever I was stuck in traffic or even in the middle of talking to someone right in front of me.

What's worse is that I got absolutely nothing out of it. Not only was I wasting time, it usually just made me feel terrible. It's full of awful news, rage bait, and hateful discussion between its users. Like Twitter and Facebook before it, Reddit has earned itself a spot in the Triumvirate of [Anger-Driven Engagement.](https://www.techdetoxbox.com/weapons-of-digital-manipulation/how-attention-economy-profits-from-outrage/) Even now, everytime I sit down on the toilet or join the end of a queue, I instinctively pull out my phone and touch the now vacant slot on my homescreen where the icon used to be.

But look at me now! A full day's work and I still managed to crank out two posts in one day. If you're struggling to move forward like me, an important first step is eliminating harmful or unproductive time sinks, espescially when you've reached the point of not even enjoying them anymore. Social Media, video games, cable news, whatever you're spending all your free time on right now, ask yourself what these things are really doing for you and start thinking about what you could do with that time each day that could actually improve your life and increase your happiness.
